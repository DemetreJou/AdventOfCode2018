# What is Advent of Code
An everyday puzzle event in December until Christmas
## About my solutions
I used Python 3.6 as it's my most famililar language and easier to set up for short scripts.
Occasionally many days were done at once as this was during my exam period
### Installing notes
Each folder is self contained as it's own day
### Running notes
Before day 6 you can run the solutions by uncommenting the appropriate lines where marked.

On day 6 and onwards I switched to using fileinput module to make reading the inputs cleaner. 
I also split each part of the solutions into two functions to make it easier to read

To run cd into the appropriate folder then run after uncommenting to get either part 1 or 2
```
$ python solution.py input.txt
```
